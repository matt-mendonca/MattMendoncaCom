    <h4>A little about myself:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I know php, SQL, JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, CSS, and Drupal very well.</li>
        <li>I know Java, C#, and the .Net Framework well enough.</li>
        <li>I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.shepherd.edu" target="_blank">Shepherd University</a>.</li>
        <li>I love front-end and back-end development; I tend to go through phases of each while learning something new. Right now it's <a href="http://symfony.com" target="_blank">Symfony 2</a>.</li>
        <li>I believe in clean aesthetics and clean programming.</li>
    </ul>
